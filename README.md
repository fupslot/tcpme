## Run Server
`tcpme serve --port 3232 --host 0.0.0.0`

## Run Client

`NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 DEBUG=* tcpme serve --port 3232 --host <host_machine_ip>`


## Config iptable rules
`iptables -A INPUT -m tcp -p tcp --dport 3232 -j LOG --log-prefix "[TCPME]"`

## iptable's log file

These logs are generated by the kernel, so they go to the file that receives kernel logs: `/var/log/kern.log`
If you want to change this to your own custom log file than follow these steps:

1. Create `rsyslog` config file for redirecting logs to a specific file

```
touch /etc/rsyslog.d/00-tcpme.conf
```

and copy/paste this context

```
:msg,contains,"[TCPME]" -/var/log/iptable/tcpme.log
& stop
```

1. Create the directory where log files should be stored

```
mkdir /var/log/iptable
```

2. Create a log file for a specific use case

```
touch /var/log/iptable/tcpme.log
```

3. Make sure that folder has a correct permissions

Otherwise `syslog` won't be able to write logs

```
chmod -R syslog:adm /var/log/iptable
```
